ACT I:
YOU are a bounty hunter/space traveller, minding your own business, doing some side quests

ACT II:
Distress signal comes from some moon far away on the other side of the galaxy. For some reason,
you fly towards it. You find the distress signal

ACT III:
It wasn't a person, it was an AI... Dunno where story will go from here.
